                                    <p>Because of crushing poverty, a difficult life of hard work, and lack of hope, many men resort to abusing alchohol to escape. Drunkeness combined with a low view of women and girls, often leads to physical and emotional abuse, infidelity and oftentimes abandonment of the family. But the Bible teaches that men are to be the primary providers and protectors of their families. God has identified himself as a loving Father and provides a unique example to which all men should seek to emulate.</p>

                                    <p class="special-quation"> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. </br><span style= "font-style: normal;" > - Ephesians 5:25-28</span></p>

                                    <p>When men come to truly embrace their identity in Jesus Christ, and their destiny as princes in an eternal Kingdom, they become transformed into purpose driven providers, lovers of their family, and bold witnesses for Christ.
